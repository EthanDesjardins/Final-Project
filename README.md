## Description
A dice game where two players roll to get the others health to zero.
Each player can decide to keep rolling and stop to keep their score,
or until they roll a 1 were they lose their score.
Player who does the most damage after the number of inputted rounds wins.

I would love to give the game more nuance in the future, such as adding more options than just rolling.
Getting the rounds to loop as well as storing the player scores was kind of challenging with my
basic knowledge.Overall I'm pretty satisfied with what came out.
